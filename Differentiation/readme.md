<code>NewtonPolynomialInterpolation</code> is a step by step solution for a second derivative problem with taylor series and Newton's polynomial interpolation. Later on the document there is a python code if you wanna test it out.

<code>Conv1_Sobel_Gauss</code> is a code made with p5js in which we pick up an image and apply Sobel both in x and y axis and Gaussian filter to it.

<code>Conv2_Gauss_Laplace</code> is a code made with p5js in which we pick up an image and apply Laplace and Gaussian filter to it.

The image is listed as <code>malenia.jpg</code> in our document and code. Feel free to test it with other images aswell.
