# Numerical Integration
<code>AreaCalcLegendre</code> i solve an given problema related to areas. In the first section i quote the given problem. In this and in the Volume document we use change of variables as well as use Gauss-Legendre's quadrature with 3 directions.
<br>

<code>Gauss_Legendre</code> in this code, we calculate each component used in the Gauss-Legendre's quadrature and return the aproximate result of the integral of a function for a determined degree of Legendre's polinomial.

<code>HLC_resultstable</code> table with examples of Hermite, Laguerre and Chebyshev's polynomials.
<br>

<code>Hermite_Laguerre_Chebyshev</code> similiar as in Gauss-Legendre's code, i develop the Gauss-Hermite, Gauss-Laguerre and Gauss-Chebyshev formulas to calculate specific integrals.
<br>

<code>MilneErrorEstimative</code> i calculate in this document an approximation of the error in Milne's formula.
<br>

<code>NewtonCotesSubstitutionPolynomialsd4</code> (long boring name sorry for that) i use an step-by-step solution to find the substitution polynomial of degree 4 in both open or closed intervals (open or closed approaches).
<br>

<code>VolCalcLegendre</code> just like the AreaCalcLegendre document, in this one we solve a similar problema related to the volume of a given region.
